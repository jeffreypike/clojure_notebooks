;   - `alt+enter` evaluates the current top level form.
;   - `ctrl+enter` evaluates the current form.
;   - `alt+up` and `alt+down` traverse up and down the REPL command history
;      when the cursor is after the last contents at the prompt
;   - Clojure lines in stack traces are peekable and clickable.
