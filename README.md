# Clojure Notebooks

A set of notebooks that implement fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).  The goal was simply to learn more about the language and have a bit of fun!  Check out the rendered notebooks [here](https://jeffreypike.github.io/clojure_notebooks/)

## TODO
- [ ] Update known inefficiencies, such as not using the outer product shortcut for adding bias terms
- [ ] Add additional context and explanations to the notebooks
- [ ] Add comparison with packages, (Scicloj for regression, Deep Java Library for NN)

## Potential Future Notebooks
- Reinforcement learning path (basics, Q-learning)
- NLP path (RNNs, basic NLP, transformer from scratch)
- Additive Modeling Path (regularization, model selection algorithms, GAMs, NAMs)
